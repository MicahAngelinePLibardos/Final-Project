    <h2>How to help</h2>

    <p>Supporting gender equality starts with awareness and action in our everyday lives. One of the most impactful ways to help is by challenging stereotypes and speaking up against sexist remarks or behavior, whether online or in real life. Educate yourself and others about the issues women face, such as wage gaps, harassment, and underrepresentation in leadership. By actively listening to women's experiences and advocating for their rights, you help create a more inclusive and respectful environment. It's also important to use inclusive language, support diverse voices, and stand in solidarity with women from all backgrounds, especially those in marginalized communities.</p>

<p>Another way to contribute is by supporting organizations and initiatives that focus on women’s rights and empowerment. This could mean donating to causes, attending gender equality events, or even promoting women-owned businesses. You can also make a difference by mentoring girls and young women, encouraging them to pursue their passions without limits. No action is too small, whether it’s calling out injustice or simply sharing informative content, your voice matters. Empowering women is not just a women’s issue, it benefits everyone by building a more fair, safe, and progressive society.</p>
