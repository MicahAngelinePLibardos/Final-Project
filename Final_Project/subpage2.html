    <h2>"Women Are Also Human"</h2>

    <p class="description">
      Many men often view women as mere objects, treating them as sexualized beings and subjecting them to harassment in various forms. This mindset makes it difficult for women to live freely without constantly facing judgment or weird looks from these men. The reality is that many women feel unsafe even in their neighborhoods, especially at night, due to the fear of potential threats from men.<br><br>

      Moreover, successful women frequently find themselves facing criticism, as some people assume that their achievements are a result of favoritism or that they “paid their way” to the top. This kind of thinking undermines the hard work and dedication that many women put into their careers and personal lives.<br><br>

      Every day, women face even more challenges that test their strength and resilience. Their struggles often go unacknowledged, contributing to a culture that overlooks their humanity.<br><br>

      I came up with the phrase emphasizing that women, like everyone else, deserve respect, understanding, and the chance to live their lives without fear or judgment because women are also human.
